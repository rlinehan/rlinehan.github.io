          <p>
          My academic background is in linguistics, and I'm often asked how I
          got into software development.

          <p>
          <p>

          My senior year I took an introductory computer science course, and I
          fell in love. At the same time, I was working as a research
          assistant for a computational linguist, for which I ended up
          learning some Python. I ended up spending a lot of my senior year teaching
          myself how to code (probably to the detriment of my senior
          thesis...).

          <p>

          There's actually a good amount of overlap in programming and
          linguistics, or at least I find that my brain processes problems in
          these two disciplines in a similar way. In linguistics classes
          focussed on morphology and syntax (formal linguistics), you often
          get problem sets which consist of a number of sentences in another
          language, accompanied by their English glosses, or translations. You
          then have to figure out how the language works: what is the sentence
          structure, how are different tenses indicated, what is the case
          system, etc. You know the input and the output, and based on that
          you have to recognize the patterns in order to figure out how it
          works.

          <p>

          This is how I approach a new programming language or a code
          base I am not yet familiar with: I have the input, and I can run it
          to get the output. Then it's a matter of recognizing different
          patterns and taking it apart piece by piece.
