          I'm fortunate that some of my past work has been <strong>open
            source</strong>. Below I have highlighted some of the open source
          contributions that I feel illustrate my skills.
          </p>

          <h4>Languages</h4>

          <p>
          I've worked in <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/trapperkeeper-status/pull/2">Clojure</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet/pull/3464">Ruby</a>,
          <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver/pull/699">Java</a>,
          <a href="https://github.com/flot/flot/pull/963">Javascript</a>,
          Python, Puppet, Bash, and more. I am not dogmatic about my
          programming language choice, and I am good at picking up new
          languages.
          </p>

          <h4>Communication</h4>
          <p>
          Writing code is never a solo activity;
          communication is one of the
          most important parts of working as a software developer.
          </p>

          <p>
          One example of my communication skills is <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/clj-http-client/pull/52">this PR,
            of a metrics API for tracking requests made by an HTTP client</a>.
          </p>

          <p>
          <strong>Designing the API</strong> for this feature involved a lot
          of collaboration with my teammates, and this PR was the second
          iteration of our design. After I began implementing the first API
          design, we realized that there were more requirements and that there
          would need to be both a Java API and a Clojure API. The commentary
          on this PR shows our communication to resolve the additional
          requirements and agree on a reasonable API for this feature.
          </p>

          <p>
          (I also believe very strongly in the importance of thorough
          <strong>testing</strong>. I think this is evident in <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/clj-http-client/pull/52/files#diff-e1299b154e662c56432912e2b3860006">the
            tests added</a> for this feature).
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h4>Understandable code</h4>

          <p>
          Being a member of a team means writing maintainable code that others
          can follow. When I review a pull request, I don't want to be
          surprised by anything, so I try to ensure the code I write meets the
          same standard. The <strong>version history</strong> should be broken
          up into distinct commits with <strong>commit messages</strong>
          describing their purpose. There should be <strong>comments</strong>
          for anything that is unexpected or confusing. It should be possible
          to follow the <strong>tests</strong>. The
          <strong>documentation</strong> should include how to run the code
          and the tests.
          </p>

          <p>
          <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb/pull/2179">This
            PR</a>, which integrates a feature I was working on with a
          codebase I didn't often contribute to, shows how I follow
          these principles.
          </p>

          <hr>

          <h4>Code review</h4>

          <p>
          I believe that code review is useful not just for
          ensuring good <strong>code quality</strong> and catching bugs before they make it to
          production, but also for <strong>knowledge
            transfer</strong> and
          ensuring team ownership of a codebase.
          </p>

          <p>
          One example of this is <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetserver/pull/944">a pull
            request I reviewed</a> which fixed a bug in some caching logic in the
          server.
          </p>

          <p>
          I was not familiar with the feature this was fixing or with this
          section of the codebase, but by
          reviewing it and ensuring that the tests were understandable
          (especially to someone unfamiliar with the code), I was later able
          to go back and work on this code myself.
          </p>

          <h4>Code reuse</h4>

          <p>
          One of the projects I worked on as a member of the Puppet Server
          team at Puppet was separating out a Clojure library used to manage
          pools of JRuby instances.
          </p>

          <p>
          We knew that other teams were starting to look into using JRuby, and
          we wanted them to be able to reuse our pooling
          functionality. By separating out the most complex code into its own
          <strong>library</strong>, we were able to refactor it to make it
          more understandable, better tested, and with a clearer API.
          </p>

          <p>
          In <strong>refactoring</strong> this code to separate the library
          out, we made sure to maintain the git history, because it held a lot
          of important context for past decisions. We <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/jruby-utils/pull/7">added
            clearer interfaces</a> so that other users could easily hook in
          functions when creating and destroying JRuby instances. We <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/jruby-utils/pull/13">made a
            clear division between what was public API and what was
            private</a> and we <a
            href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/jruby-utils/pull/15">separated
            the namespaces out</a> so that this distinction was plain.
          </p>

          <p>
          We also were able to simplify the tests significantly. When this
          code had been part of a larger application, the tests had to do a
          lot of mocking and were full of race conditions. We were able to
          clean up these tests to make them more reliable and more
          understandable, and in doing so we <strong>decreased the test
            time</strong> of the application by 25%.
          </p>

          <p>
          I think we succeeded in building a library that provided a reusable
          interface to a very complicated system of lifecycle decisions and
          concurrency problems.
