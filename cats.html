          So, here's the deal. Anyone who follows me on social media or who
          talks with me for any length of time IRL knows that there are a lot
          of cats in my life.

          <p><p>

          That's not really on purpose.

          <p>

          I mean, I like cats, a lot. They're definitely my favorite animal.
          If I were an animal, it would be a black cat.  I've had cats as pets
          since I was 10.

          <p>

          But... this is a bit more than that. See, the neighborhood I live in
          has a lot of feral cats. Probably when people moved out of houses
          they left cats behind, or just dumped them in the empty lot/farm
          down the street, and then they had babies, and now there are just
          many cats.

          <p>

          We feed some of them, and several of our neighbors also put out
          food, and we've trapped 7 and taken them to the <a
            href="https://feralcats.com">Feral Cat Coalition of Oregon</a> to
          get them fixed.

          <p>

          Here's the cast of characters:

          <p>

          Frankie Meowface - RIP, bestest of cats. Frankie showed up several
          years ago, and, unlike everyone else in the neighborhood, she was
          definitely a stray, not a feral (that is, she was super into humans;
          feral cats have not been socialized with humans). She pretty quickly
          learned 1) that we were suckers, and 2) how to get into the house -
          including via the skylight. And then she determined that it was
          definitely her house, and we were her people. But she was also a
          sweetheart to everyone and maybe a bit of a party girl - she would
          hear clinking of bottles at our neighbor's and run across the street
          to join the party. One neighbor called her the "neighborhood
          strumpet." Devastatingly, Frankie was hit and killed by a car in
          April, 2017.

          <p>

          Willa - Willa's been around for while, probably the longest of the
          current roster of cats. Originally known as "Leroy's girlfriend"
          because she would follow Leroy (the giant orange feather duster who
          eventually moved away) around the neighborhood. Sometimes she'll see
          us coming around the corner and will follow us home and then ask for
          headbutts - we put our hand out and she butts her head up against
          it. And then sometimes she gets feisty and instead she whaps at your
          hand with her paw. Her ear is tipped, so at some point someone must
          have gotten her fixed.

          <p>


          Gremlin - Gremlin was very grumpy, kinda gross (or at least a <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-t-JqgQgXu">gross eater</a>),
          and a reluctant mother. She had two adorable tuxedo kittens, Muffin
          and Mogwai, somewhere near our backyard, and we saw her <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/-t-nekQgYo/">watching
            over</a> them several times back there. Once they got old enough
          to eat dry food, she showed them the food on our porch, and then not
          too long after that she took up residence on the office chair on the
          front porch, and got really annoyed when the kittens still tried to
          follow her around. Unfortunately, the FCCO discovered that the wound
          on her face was really an infected tumor, and so they put her to
          sleep.

          <p>

          Mogwai - Little asshole cat. Has the best faces - mostly of the
          grumpy and "ohgodohgodohgod" variety, with occasionally very cute
          but totally begging. She rules the porch

          <p>

          Muffin - most adorable little tuxedo kitten and I love her so much
          and I just want to be her friend! She seems to be permanently catten
          (somewhere between kitten and cat) size. She follows Zero-Day around
          and it's so cute. Sometimes they <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BLcL7-YDOXr">eat from the same
            bowl</a>.  She's pretty bad at eating -  when she was a kitten and
          we used to put out food in tupperwear containers she would push the
          container all across the porch (which is why we finally got some
          ceramic cat food bowls). Sometimes we don't see her at all for a few
          days, and then she'll show up again and meow for food (which is so
          cute omg).

          <p>

          The story of the three identical black tomcats: Glitch, Missing-No,
          and Zero-Day. So alright, when we first decided to catch some feral
          cats and get them fixed, we only thought there was one black tomcat.
          Our cat-catching goals were to get Gremlin and the kittens, with a
          stretch goal of getting the tomcat Gremlin was hanging out with. Our
          first night of setting the traps, we caught Glitch and the two
          kittens, but had no luck with Gremlin. But then while the three of
          them were at the FCCO having their operations we put out more food
          for Gremlin... and A SECOND black tom showed up with her. Thankfully
          we managed to catch both of them (or so we thought) and take them to
          the FCCO to get them fixed, but then while Missing-No (the second
          black tom) was cooling his heels in our basement (i.e. recovering
          from surgery) we put out food and A THIRD black tom showed up (we
          knew it was a third cat because he didn't have a tipped ear).
          Goddamnit. We named him Zero-Day, and we realized that he was
          probably the cat we had been seeing with Gremlin all along, because
          the kittens seemed to be familiar with him (and Muffin still follows
          him around). We finally managed to trap him and get him fixed summer
          of 2017.

          <p>

          Glitch - the first of the 3 identical black tomcats. Very skittish,
          although sloooowly becoming less so since he was fixed. He
          mostly hangs out on the porch across the street, but he's been
          coming over a bit more reliably, and he really seems to have chilled
          out. He can now sometimes be found flopped out on the porch stairs
          across the street. He's identifiable by his super pointy ears.

          <p>

          Missing-No - 2nd of the identical black tomcats. Named after the
          most famous of the Glitch Pokemon. We caught him second (or so we
          think? honestly who knows - he was one of the first two, with
          Glitch). We haven't seen him since (unless we have?) - we think he
          was just wandering through and had a really bad day.

          <p>

          Zero-Day - big big big sketchy boy. A bit less skittish than Glitch, with
          less point ears and a wider face. Very big and very sketchy. He's
          got some scarring on his face from getting in fights. Often naps on
          our back picnic table; it took us a long time to catch him because
          he didn't often come by for food, just to sleep on the table. Muffin
          follows him around - she loves him soooo much and he seems to
          tolerate her. We finally trapped him and got him fixed summer of
          2017. (And we didn't manage to get him the first day; we trapped
          Bruce and then didn't trap Zero until the next morning and had to
          make another trip to the FCCO for him).

          <p>

          Bruce "Wipeout" Jones, III - sketchiest cat; giant grey and white
          fluff. So named because one day we were walking home and he was up
          on the porch eating. He saw us and ran off to the side of the porch
          as we climbed up the stairs... but then he realized he was too big
          to fit through the porch railings so he had to escape past us down
          the front steps. He Tokyo-drifted down the first set of stairs then
          launched himself off the landing and onto the street. He's just this
          big ball of grey and white fluff! He was getting less sketchy but
          then in July of 2017 we finally trapped him to get his balls chopped
          off at the FCCO and we've only seen him a couple times since then.

          <p>

          Eclipse (Fluffy Cat) - a new edition, summer of 2017. Super fluffy
          and pretty! We don't know her story yet, but we think maybe she was
          someone's cat and they dumped her, but now she's been on her own for
          a while and so is pretty skitty. We might try to see if she'll
          become a people-cat again.

          <p>

          The Skunk - okay, not actually a cat, and probably there's more than
          one, and we try not to feed it, but sometimes it gets food anyway
          and then seriously what can we do, it's a skunk. TBH it's pretty cute
          though.

          <p>
