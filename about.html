          Hi, I'm Ruth! I'm a software developer based in Portland, OR.

          <p>
          <p>
          I have 5+ years of professional dev experience, primarily as a
          backend engineer, with some front end and full stack work.

          <!--
          <p>

          I've worked in Clojure, Ruby, Python, Java, Javascript, Puppet,
          Bash.... I am not at all dogmatic about my programming language
          choice, and I am good at picking up new languages.
          -->

          <p>

          I love what I do because I love solving problems, learning new
          things, and building things that people can use.

          <p>

          I'm really good at understanding complex systems. As a friend put
          it, I'm an accomplished "contemporary archaeologist" - I will dive
          into a code base to learn its intricacies, while also acquiring an
          understanding of the big picture (why are we building this thing?
          who are the users? what are their problems? what are all the parts
          of the solution?) so that I am able to explain how all the pieces
          fit together.

          <p>

          But I also believe strongly in making the archaeology of a code base
          easier for everyone who encounters it. That means good commit
          messages and a clear git log, tests that illustrate how the code
          should work, documentation, and team code review.

          <p>

          I believe that code review is a tool not just to ensure good code
          quality and catch bugs before they make it to production, it is also
          an important tool for knowledge transfer.

          <p>

          Outside of work, I run, hike, swim, camp, and generally enjoy the
          outdoors. I don't own a car and get around primarily by bike. I read
          a lot. I do a weird singing thing called <a
            href="https://fasola.org/">Sacred Harp</a>. I really like <a
            href="./cats.html">cats</a>.

          <p>
          My academic background is in linguistics - I have a B.A. in
          linguistics from Reed College, in Portland. My senior year I took an
          introductory computer science course, and I fell in love.  I ended
          up spending a lot of my senior year teaching myself how to code.

          <p>

          There's actually a good amount of overlap in programming and
          linguistics, or at least I find that my brain processes problems in
          these two disciplines in a similar way. In linguistics classes
          focussed on morphology and syntax (formal linguistics), you often
          get problem sets which consist of a number of sentences in another
          language, accompanied by their English glosses, or translations. You
          then have to figure out how the language works: what is the sentence
          structure, how are different tenses indicated, what is the case
          system, etc. You know the input and the output, and based on that
          you have to recognize the patterns in order to figure out how it
          works. This is how I approach a new programming language or a code
          base I am not yet familiar with: I have the input, and I can run it
          to get the output. Then it's a matter of recognizing different
          patterns and taking it apart piece by piece.
